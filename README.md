# Midterm Lab Task 3: Creating PIVOT TABLE and DASHBOARD
This portfolio highlights the process of creating Pivot Tables and a Dashboard to visualize insights from a transformed dataset. The dataset includes multiple related tables that were cleaned and structured using Power Query.

## STEP 1. Data Preparation Using Power Query
- Load the cleaned dataset and transformed tables from Midterm Lab Task 2
- Ensure data consistency and proper formatting
- Create additional queries if needed for further analysis

## STEP 2. Creating Pivot Tables in Excel
Generate Pivot Tables for key insights:
- State with the highest number of Data Science jobs
- Job Role with the highest average salary
- Company size that pays the highest salaries
- Sector that employs the highest and lowest number of Data Science roles
- Sector with the minimum and maximum average salaries (requires additional query)

## STEP 3. Creating the Dashboard
- Design a Dashboard incorporating all Pivot Tables
- Use charts such as bar charts, pie charts, and column charts for visualization
- Insert slicers for Role Type, Company Size, and State to make the Dashboard interactive
- Include a Map visualization if supported by Excel version
- Apply professional and visually appealing color schemes
- Ensure all necessary visuals and reports are included
